Introductory react application that basically permits the user to interact with the webpage by deleting contents on the home page.
 
 This project introduced me to the core basics of react that deals with passing props from one component to another, states that involves collection and manipulation of data, and also redux which is basically a component wehere data can be stored and shared with other components as the need may be. hence managing the state.
 In a better definition; 
 Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state.
 
 Also learnt about reducers. 
 
 A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. ... Redux relies heavily on reducer functions that take the previous state and an action in order to execute the next state.
 
 Reducer basically help us interact with the store in a big/proper application. 
 Many reducers are created for different types of data that will be collected
Hence i  must then create a final reducer called the rootReducer to merge all other reducers.
